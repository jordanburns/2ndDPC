    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div id="content">
        <p id="mission">Our Mission Statement:</p>

        achieving excellence in all elements of our business performance. We

        <p>Diversified Plastics Corporation lives up to its name by molding a
        diversity of plastics from expandable foam polymers to injection molded
        engineering grade hard plastics.</p>
        <p>Founded in Nixa, Missouri in early 1969, DPC began in an abandoned
        cheese factory.</p>
        <p>In 1972, DPC moved into injection molding and in 1973 built a new
        facility in Nixa. In 1976 it constructed a second molding facility near
        Centralia, Missouri and that same year won a Gold Award for Excellence
        in packaging design and service from the Society of Plastics
        Industry.</p>
        <p>DPC expanded into proprietary molding in 1977 with its
        Diversa-Shield exterior insulation sheeting. In 1982, DPC partnered
        with Huntsman and General Electric to develop a new heat-resistant
        co-polymer for use in molding interior components for the automotive
        industry. By 1983 they were molding the first part from this
        revolutionary new material the Chevrolet Corvette dashboard.</p>
        <p>DPC stepped into another arena in 1986 holding lost foam patterns
        for the foundry industry. They quickly became one of the foremost
        molders of close-tolerance foam patterns.</p>
        <p>In 1987, DPC became the first molder in the world certified to mold
        parts using General Electric's new GECET material. AT&T certified DPC
        as a Vendor Partner in 1989. In 1992 DPC s injection molding division
        was named a Certified Supplier for General Electric. That same year,
        DPC earned Ford Motor Companyâ€™s highest quality award in the Q1 rating.
        In 2006, DPC became ISO14001 certified. In 2007 DPC became ISO/TS16949
        certified.</p>
        <p>In 2002, DPC began a new venture by molding IFCs Insulated Concrete
        Forms for the construction business.</p>
        <p>Since its humble beginnings, Diversified Plastics has grown into a
        leader in the plastics industry in the field of innovations, quality
        molding, setting standards for service and timeliness, and in
        developing cutting edge technology.</p>
