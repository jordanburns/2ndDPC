        <p class="mission">Our Mission Statement:</p>
        <p class="mission">Diversified Plastics Corporation will supply only
        first-class products for its customers at a competitive price which
        provides an adequate return on our investment. We are committed to
        achieving excellence in all elements of our business performance. We
        believe that one of the foundations upon which this goal will be met is
        dedication to the continual and persistent search for improvement
        within product, process, and personnel to achieve customer
        satisfaction. We will maximize job opportunity and personal growth
        potential for our employees while dedicating ourselves to CONTINUOUS
        IMPROVEMENT in all phases of our operations.</p>
        <p>Diversified Plastics Corporation lives up to its name by molding a
        diversity of plastics from expandable foam polymers to injection molded
        engineering grade hard plastics.</p>
        <p>Founded in Nixa, Missouri in early 1969, DPC began in an abandoned
        cheese factory.</p>
        <p>In 1972, DPC moved into injection molding and in 1973 built a new
        facility in Nixa. In 1976 it constructed a second molding facility near
        Centralia, Missouri and that same year won a Gold Award for Excellence
        in packaging design and service from the Society of Plastics
        Industry.</p>
        <p>DPC expanded into proprietary molding in 1977 with its
        Diversa-Shield exterior insulation sheeting. In 1982, DPC partnered
        with Huntsman and General Electric to develop a new heat-resistant
        co-polymer for use in molding interior components for the automotive
        industry. By 1983 they were molding the first part from this
        revolutionary new material the Chevrolet Corvette dashboard.</p>
        <p>DPC stepped into another arena in 1986 holding lost foam patterns
        for the foundry industry. They quickly became one of the foremost
        molders of close-tolerance foam patterns.</p>
        <p>In 1987, DPC became the first molder in the world certified to mold
        parts using General Electric's new GECET material. AT&T certified DPC
        as a Vendor Partner in 1989. In 1992 DPC s injection molding division
        was named a Certified Supplier for General Electric. That same year,
        DPC earned Ford Motor Company’s highest quality award in the Q1 rating.
        In 2006, DPC became ISO14001 certified. In 2007 DPC became ISO/TS16949
        certified.</p>
        <p>In 2002, DPC began a new venture by molding IFCs Insulated Concrete
        Forms for the construction business.</p>
        <p>Since its humble beginnings, Diversified Plastics has grown into a
        leader in the plastics industry in the field of innovations, quality
        molding, setting standards for service and timeliness, and in
        developing cutting edge technology.</p>
