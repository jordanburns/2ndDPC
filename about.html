    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div id="content">
        <p id="mission">Our Mission Statement:</p>
        <p id="mission2">Diversified Plastics Corporation will supply only

        provides an adequate return on our investment. We are committed to
        achieving excellence in all elements of our business performance. We

        potential for our employees while dedicating ourselves to CONTINUOUS
        IMPROVEMENT in all phases of our operations.</p>
        <p>Diversified Plastics Corporation lives up to its name by molding a
        diversity of plastics from expandable foam polymers to injection molded
        engineering grade hard plastics.</p>
        <p>Founded in Nixa, Missouri in early 1969, D.P.C. began in an
        abandoned cheese factory.</p>
        <p>In 1972, D.P.C. moved into injection molding and in 1973 built a new
        facility in Nixa. In 1976 it constructed a second molding facility near
        Centralia, Missouri and that same year won a Gold Award for Excellence
        in packaging design and service from the Society of Plastics
        Industry.</p>
        <p>D.P.C. expanded into proprietary molding in 1977 with its
        Diversa-Shield exterior insulation sheeting. In 1982, D.P.C. partnered
        with Huntsman and General Electric to develop a new heat-resistant
        co-polymer for use in molding interior components for the automotive
        industry. By 1983 they were molding the first part from this
        revolutionary new material the Chevrolet Corvette dashboard.</p>
        <p>D.P.C. stepped into another arena in 1986 holding lost foam patterns
        for the foundry industry. They quickly became one of the foremost
        molders of close-tolerance foam patterns.</p>
        <p>In 1987, D.P.C. became the first molder in the world certified to
        mold parts using General Electric's new G.E.C.E.T. material. AT&T
        certified D.P.C. as a Vendor Partner in 1989. In 1992 D.P.C. s
        injection molding division was named a Certified Supplier for General
        Electric. That same year, D.P.C. earned Ford Motor Company’s highest
        quality award in the Q1 rating. In 2006, D.P.C. became ISO14001
        certified. In 2007 D.P.C. became ISO/TS16949 certified.</p>
        <p>In 2002, D.P.C. began a new venture by molding I.F.C.s (Insulated
        Concrete Forms) for the construction business.</p>
        <p>Since its humble beginnings, Diversified Plastics has grown into a
        leader in the plastics industry in the field of innovations, quality
        molding, setting standards for service and timeliness, and in
        developing cutting edge technology.</p>
