        <p>DPC has been in Nixa, Missouri since the very beginning, when it was
        founded in an abandoned cheese factory. In 1973, DPC built a new
        facility in Nixa after moving into injection molding. In 1976, there
        was a second molding facility constructed in Centralia, Missouri. To
        this day, we still call Nixa home.</p>
