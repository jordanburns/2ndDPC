                <h3>Expandable Polypropylene</h3>
                <p>E.P.P. is a resilient, durable foam with marvelous cushioning
                properties and phenomenal ‘memory’ that returns it to its
                original shape after being deformed by a blow or static weight.
                Because of these properties, it excels as a packaging material
                and is durable enough to provide an exceptional material for
                reusable dunnage. These properties also make it the optimum for
                use in high-impact interior components for automobiles.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wide range of densities (1.3 to 10 P.C.F.)</li>
                    <li>Ideal for fragile or heavy items needing packaging</li>
                    <li>Durable and reusable</li>

                <h3>Expandable Polystyrene</h3>
                <p>E.P.S. is a low density water resistant product that can comply
                with F.D.A. requirements for use in direct food contact use. It
                is an inexpensive cushioning material that is commonly used for
                all sorts of shape-molded and fabricated packaging. It also
                features such a high degree of thermal protection properties
                that it is commonly used for insulated shippers and coolers.
                Because it can be molded in a variety of densities, it is also
                used to mold products of all descriptions. ‘Lost Foam’ patterns
                for the foundry industry are almost exclusively molded from EPS
                material.</p>
