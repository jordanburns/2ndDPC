                <h3>Expandable Polypropylene (E.P.P.)</h3>
                <p>E.P.P. is a resilient, durable foam with marvelous
                cushioning properties and phenomenal ‘memory’ that returns it
                to its original shape after being deformed by a blow or static
                weight. Because of these properties, it excels as a packaging
                material and is durable enough to provide an exceptional
                material for reusable dunnage. These properties also make it
                the optimum for use in high-impact interior components for
                automobiles.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wide range of densities (1.3 to 10 P.C.F.)</li>
                    <li>Ideal for fragile or heavy items needing packaging</li>
                    <li>Durable and reusable</li>

                <h3>Expandable Polystyrene (E.P.S.)</h3>
                <p>E.P.S. is a low density water resistant product that can
                comply with F.D.A. requirements for use in direct food contact
                use. It is an inexpensive cushioning material that is commonly
                used for all sorts of shape-molded and fabricated packaging. It
                also features such a high degree of thermal protection
                properties that it is commonly used for insulated shippers and
                coolers. Because it can be molded in a variety of densities, it
                is also used to mold products of all descriptions. ‘Lost Foam’
                patterns for the foundry industry are almost exclusively molded
                from EPS material.</p>
